I'm a Career Development Fellow in Artificial Intelligence at St Hughs College, Oxford. I'm working on enforcing safety in AI, working closely with the Oxford Control & Verification group within the Department of Computer Science.

After receiving my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich in 2019, I worked on the Mars2020 rover at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. I completed my DPhil at Oxford's Department of Engineering Science in 2024.
 
My research interests concern the verification of learned models and safety enforcement during the training of learning-based controllers for complex dynamical systems. My work has been applied to spacecraft trajectory design and airborne wind energy, among other applications.
