I am a Doctoral student under the supervision of Kostas Margellos and Sina Ober-Blöbaum at the University of Oxford. My research interests currently focus on Safety-Critical Control and Optimization of Complex Systems.

I received a Bachelors's degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich in 2019. While at ETH, I was the avionics lead for the Swiss Academic Space Initiative. After graduating, I took on an internship at the Jet Propulsion Labs in Pasadena, California, where I worked on the Mars2020 rover.
