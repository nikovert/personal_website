I am a Career Development Fellow in Artificial Intelligence at St Hugh's College, Oxford, and a member of the Oxford Control & Verification group within the Department of Computer Science. My work focuses on safe reinforcement learning and safe learning-based control.

I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from ETH Zurich in 2019. Following this, I worked at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the Mars 2020 rover mission. In 2024, I completed my DPhil at Oxford's Department of Engineering Science.

My research interests include the verification of learned models, finite-sample learning, and safe reinforcement learning. I have applied my research to spacecraft trajectory design and airborne wind energy systems, among  other applications.
