abstract: We propose a reachability approach for infinite and finite horizon
  multi-objective optimization problems for low-thrust spacecraft trajectory
  design. The main advantage of the proposed method is that the Pareto front can
  be efficiently constructed from the zero level set of the solution to a
  Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We demonstrate the proposed method by
  applying it to a low-thrust spacecraft trajectory design problem. By deriving
  the analytic expression for the Hamiltonian and the optimal control policy, we
  are able to efficiently compute the backward reachable set and reconstruct the
  optimal trajectories. Furthermore, we show that any reconstructed trajectory
  will be guaranteed to be weakly Pareto optimal. The proposed method can be
  used as a benchmark for future research of applying reachability analysis to
  low-thrust spacecraft trajectory design.
