abstract: "Neural networks hold great potential to act as approximate models of
  nonlinear dynamical systems, with the resulting neural approximations enabling
  verification and control of such systems. However, in safety-critical
  contexts, the use of neural approximations requires formal bounds on their
  closeness to the underlying system. To address this fundamental challenge, we
  propose a novel, adaptive, and parallelizable verification method based on
  certified first-order models. Our approach provides formal error bounds on the
  neural approximations of dynamical systems, allowing them to be safely
  employed as surrogates by interpreting the error bound as bounded disturbances
  acting on the approximated dynamics. We demonstrate the effectiveness and
  scalability of our method on a range of established benchmarks from the
  literature, showing that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we
  highlight the flexibility of our framework by applying it to two novel
  scenarios not previously explored in this context: neural network compression
  and an autoencoder-based deep learning architecture for learning Koopman
  operators, both yielding compelling results."
