abstract: "Vertovec’s social organisation of difference framework links three
  research areas. They study difference and its social importance: encounters,
  representations, and structural configurations. This paper argues for an
  expansion of the framework. It should recognise that those three domains are
  co-constituted and mediated by technical transformations and material
  sedimentations. An expanded focus is vital to address old and new
  inequalities. While Vertovec’s original framework paid limited attention to
  techno-material entanglements, we highlight their importance. The material and
  the technical matter at the intersections of encounters, representations, and
  configurations. Where possible, we point to examples. We thus call for more
  research and cross-disciplinary dialogue beyond the social sciences. We
  re-emphasise the framework’s usefulness for this and for engaging with (urban)
  complexities and difference. As a think-piece, the article shows the benefits
  of nuancing Vertovec’s framework by considering the technical and material."
