abstract: A fundamental concern in progressing airborne wind energy (AWE)
  operations toward commercial success is guaranteeing that safety requirements
  placed on the systems are met. Due to the high-dimensional complexity of AWE
  systems, however, formal mathematical robustness guarantees become difficult
  to compute. We draw on research from Hamilton–Jacobi (HJ) reachability
  analysis to compute an avoidance control maneuver for the path-following
  controller that enforces safety constraints on the system while maintaining
  the guidance strategy. In addition, the subzero level set of the computed
  value function inherent in HJ reachability analysis indicates the backward
  reachable set, the set of states from which it is possible to safely drive the
  system into a target set within a given time without entering undesirable
  states. Furthermore, to integrate the avoidance controller with the
  path-following controller, we derive the necessary switching law such that the
  avoidance maneuver is only initiated when a tether rupture is potentially
  imminent. We illustrate our results via extensive simulation-based studies.
