abstract: A fundamental concern in moving Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) operations
  towards commercial success, is guaranteeing that safety requirements placed on
  the systems are met. Due to the high dimensional complexity of AWE systems,
  however, formal mathematical robustness guarantees become difficult to
  compute. We draw on research from high dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ)
  reachability analysis to compute the optimal trajectory for tracking a
  figure-eight flight path during the pumping cycle, while enforcing safety
  constraints on the system, such as those placed on the tether force. In
  addition to providing the optimal control policy, the zero sub-levelset of the
  computed value function inherent in HJ reachability analysis indicates the
  backward reachable set (BRS), the set of states from which it is possible to
  safely drive the system into a target set within a given time without entering
  undesirable states, defined by an avoid set. Furthermore, we derive a
  switching law, such that the safety controller can be used in conjunction with
  arbitrary least restrictive controllers to provide a safe hybrid control law.
  In such a setup, the safety controller is only activated when the system
  approaches the boundary of its maneuverability envelope. Such a hybrid control
  law is a notable improvement over existing robust control approaches that
  assume the worst-case environmental and system behavior at all times, leading
  to potentially sub-optimal control laws.
