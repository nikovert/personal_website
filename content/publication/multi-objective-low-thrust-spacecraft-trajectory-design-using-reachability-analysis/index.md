abstract: One of the fundamental problems in spacecraft trajectory design is
  finding the optimal transfer trajectory that minimizes the propellant
  consumption and transfer time simultaneously. We formulate this as a
  multi-objective optimal control (MOC) problem that involves optimizing over
  the initial or final state, subject to state constraints. Drawing on recent
  developments in reachability analysis subject to state constraints, we show
  that the proposed MOC problem can be stated as an optimization problem subject
  to a constraint that involves the sub-level set of the viscosity solution of a
  quasi-variational inequality. We then generalize this approach to account for
  more general optimal control problems in Bolza form. We relate these problems
  to the Pareto front of the developed multi-objective programs. The proposed
  approach is demonstrated on two low thrust orbital transfer problems around a
  rotating asteroid.
