abstract: We consider a moving target that we seek to learn from samples. Our
  results extend randomized techniques developed in control and optimization for
  a constant target to the case where the target is changing. We derive a novel
  bound on the number of samples that are required to construct a probably
  approximately correct (PAC) estimate of the target. Furthermore, when the
  moving target is a convex polytope, we provide a constructive method of
  generating the PAC estimate using a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The
  proposed method is demonstrated on an application to autonomous emergency
  braking.
